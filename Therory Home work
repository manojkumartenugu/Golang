explain why goroutines are preferred over threads.
Goroutines are very similar to threads, the major difference between then are as follows
1.	threads are managed by OS whereas goroutines are managed by go run time
2.	threads stack of 1 mb on the other hand goroutines stack is 2kb which make them very list and faster compared to threads.
3.	Threads are hardware depended on and goroutine are not hardware dependent.
4.	Goroutines have channel which helps in communication, and this are absent in threads.
5.	Goroutines have faster startup time then threads.
